# Designing CLDK changes

The design mode of the CLDK ladder. Structural work — anything that moves the
shared contract or spans repos — is designed here, as a spec plus a GitHub
tracking record, **before** any implementation rung runs. You own contract
evolution; the rungs (`codeanalyzer-backend`, `cldk-sdk-frontend`) consume what
you decide.

## Entry Preconditions

You are here because the work is structural: a new language, schema v2
evolution/migration, a new analysis level (L2/L3/L4), a new SDK facade surface, or
any cross-repo feature. If it arrived as a "small fix" that turned out to move
the schema v2 output or the public SDK API, **maintaining-cldk**'s contract gate
escalated it here — say so and continue; it is now a structural change, not a fix.

## Contract-Impact Triage

**First move, always — before any design detail.** Answer, out loud:

1. **Does this change the schema v2 output?** (a new node/edge kind, field, level,
   or id shape) — the keystone is `references/canonical-schema.md`.
2. **Which repos are touched** — analyzers, SDKs, docs?

Then state the change-type → repos-affected mapping:

| Change type | Analyzers | SDKs | Docs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New language | new `codeanalyzer-<lang>` | `python-sdk` (+ TS SDK) | docs |
| Schema v2 evolution / migration | every affected `codeanalyzer-*` | every affected SDK | docs |
| New analysis level (L2/L3/L4) | that `codeanalyzer-<lang>` | SDK only if the surface changes | docs |
| New facade surface / SDK feature | — | `python-sdk` (+ TS SDK) | docs |
| Docs-only structural change | — | — | docs |

Siblings share the schema — a "one analyzer" change is rarely one repo. Name
every affected repo now. This list is the input to the decomposition decision
below — it is not itself a list of issues to file.

## Design Loops

Run the matching loop **WITH the user, never solo** — every divergence is the
user's decision (`AskUserQuestion`), not a silent pick:

- **Analyzer-side** (schema shape: node/edge kinds, fields a language adds) →
  `references/schema-design-loop.md`, anchored on `references/canonical-schema.md`.
- **SDK-side** (facade query surface) → `references/sdk-facade-design-loop.md`,
  anchored on the Java + Python + C facades.
- **Migrating an existing analyzer/SDK to a new schema major** →
  `references/schema-migration.md` (compat shims, staging, version lockstep).

A new-language change usually runs both loops; a facade-only change runs just the
SDK loop.

## Decomposition and Release Plan

**Decide this WITH the user — `AskUserQuestion`, never solo.** The affected-repo
list says what the change touches; it does not say how many issues to file.
Filing one issue per repo per rung by reflex is how a backlog stops being
readable, and an unreadable backlog buries the design record it was meant to
preserve. Put both questions to the user once the triage and design loop are done:

**The rule that replaces counting: tracking granularity follows PR granularity.**
Never step count, never repo count. Does a pull request close it? Then it is an
issue. Is it a step inside a PR? Then it is a checkbox in that issue's `GOALS`.

1. **Decomposition — what tracking shape?** Offer the range, recommend one:
   - **One work item**, rungs as checklist items — the default when the change
     lands in one PR.
   - **Epic + one sub-issue per PR** — when the work spans repos that ship on their
     own clocks and need a coordination record.
   - **Epic + a sub-issue stack** — only when a rung is genuinely heavy (a full
     L3/L4 build, a multi-stage migration) and its units land as separate PRs.
2. **Release plan — what ships when?** Which release or train carries each piece,
   what gates what, and where two repos need version lockstep. A decomposition
   without a release plan is a pile of issues in no order.

Fewer, well-scoped issues beat more, thinner ones. When unsure, propose the smaller
shape and let the user expand it.

**File children just-in-time.** An epic is filed at design time; its children are
filed as each unit is picked up, not all at once up front. The committed spec
already records the full plan — the backlog does not need to mirror it. Issues
filed ahead of the work are inventory, and inventory rots.

## <HARD-GATE>

No implementation rung may be entered for structural work until **the spec exists
and the work is tracked on GitHub**. What "tracked" means is the decomposition
decision above — for a single-repo change, one issue is a complete answer.

The gate binds to the design being written down and findable. It never binds to an
issue count: do not skip the record, and do not inflate it either.

## Spec → Tracking Record

1. **Produce and COMMIT the spec** — the triage table, the design-loop decisions,
   the affected-repo list, and the release plan. `docs/superpowers/specs/` is
   committed as provenance, so the spec is a reviewable, diffable artifact.
2. **File what the decomposition decision chose**, using
   `references/epic-and-issue-templates.md`. Issue bodies come from the org-level
   forms in `codellm-devkit/.github` (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/epic.yml`,
   `work_item.yml`); the reference file covers which shape, when, and how to wire
   sub-issues.
3. **Link the spec — do not paste it.** The epic carries a path to the committed
   spec plus a short summary. Duplicating the design into the issue body is what
   made epic bodies unreadable.

Children attach as **native GitHub sub-issues**, never a hand-maintained `CHILDREN`
checklist and never `Part of #N` trailers.

Only when the spec and its tracking record both exist is the gate satisfied.

## Terminal State

The ONLY skill you invoke after designing-cldk-changes is the first affected
rung: codeanalyzer-backend if any analyzer is touched, else cldk-sdk-frontend if
only SDK surface is touched, else finishing-cldk-work (docs-only structural
change).

**Checkpoint first.** Do not auto-invoke it. Summarize the locked decisions, the
release plan, and where the tracking record lives, then `AskUserQuestion` —
start the first rung now, start a different one, or stop here (see
`using-cldk-devtools` → Transition Checkpoint). Parking after the spec and epic
is a legitimate outcome: the gate is satisfied, and implementation can start in
a later session without losing anything.

## Red Flags

| Rationalization | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "We can write it up after it ships." | The gate exists precisely for this — the spec + epic are inputs to implementation, not paperwork produced afterward. |
| "It's a small additive change." | Additive schema changes still move the shared cross-language vocabulary; they enter design, under the gate. |
| "One issue can't be enough — this is structural." | Structural is about the contract moving, not about issue count. A single-repo change tracked in one well-scoped issue satisfies the gate. |
| "I'll file one per repo per rung, to be safe." | That reflex is what makes a backlog unreadable. Decomposition is a decision you put to the user, not a default you apply. |
| "The user is busy; I'll pick the decomposition and release plan myself." | Every divergence is the user's call — decomposition and release plan included. `AskUserQuestion`, never solo. |
| "A heads-up to the SDK is enough." | An affected repo is tracked — as its own child when the decomposition calls for one, otherwise as a named checklist item. Not a courtesy ping. |
| "I'll file every child now so nothing is forgotten." | The committed spec is what stops things being forgotten. Children are filed as they are picked up; filing ahead creates inventory that goes stale and buries the live issues. |
| "I'll paste the design summary into the epic so it's self-contained." | Link the committed spec. Pasting is what made epic bodies unreadable, and a doc is reviewable and diffable where an issue body is neither. |
| "I'll add a CHILDREN checklist so progress is visible." | Sub-issues roll up natively. A hand-maintained checklist drifts the moment anything moves, and so do `Part of #N` trailers. |
| "I'll just patch the parser / SDK model directly." | That is implementing before triage. Run Contract-Impact Triage first. |
